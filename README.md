# PB-Pairs  
3rd Year Software Development Project  

Hello and welcome to my 3rd Year Software Development Project.  
For the project I created a game based on the classic card game "Pairs".   
I built the game for Windows and Mac as they are the most readily availble OS.   
The project was written in C# and built using Unity3D 5.6.

USER GUIDE: 
1. To run the game simply download and extract the project files and run the "PB Pairs.exe" file.    
2. You will be given a menu to select your desired resolution.  
3. Select your resolution and click Play.   
4. The game will start and you will be presented with a "Play" and "Quit" button.  
5. Press "Quit" to close the application if you are not interesested in playing right now.  
6. Otherwise press "Play.  
7. The game will now load and you will be shown 26 face-down playing cards.  
8. There are 13 pairs of cards in the face-down cards.  
9. Your objective is to find all of them.   
10. Click on a card to turn it, it will show a standard playing card (eg. "2 of Clubs")  
11. Click another card to turn it and check if you have found the pair.   
12. If you have not, both cards will flip back over automatically.   
13. This game is a test of memory. You have to remember what cards you have flipped and their location.     
14. When you manage to find a pair the "Pairs Remaining" counter at the bottom of the screen will tick down.   
15. When the counter reaches 0 you will be presented a Win Screen.  
16. You can iether quit or play again from the win screen.  
17. Have fun!!
